The game prompts the player to guess a number between 1 and 100.
For each guess, the program checks if the guessed number is correct.
If the guess is greater than the target number, the program prints:
"Oops! Sorry, too high."
If the guess is less than the target number, the program prints:
"Oops! Sorry, too low."
If the guess matches the target number, the program prints:
"Yayyy! Your guessed number is correct. You took [number of tries]!"
After a correct guess, the program asks the player if they want to continue playing:

If the player enters "y", the game restarts, and a new random number is generated for the next round.
If the player enters "n", the game ends with a thank-you message.
In the image:

The first round took 9 tries to guess the correct number.
The second round took 4 tries, after which the user chose to exit by pressing "n".
