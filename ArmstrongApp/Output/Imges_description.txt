Input: 153
153 is an Armstrong number because the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits equals the original number.
For 153:

The number has 3 digits (1, 5, 3).
To check if it's an Armstrong number, we calculate the sum of each digit raised to the power of 3 (since there are 3 digits):
res=1^3+5^3+3^3=1+125+27=153
Since the sum equals the original number (153), it is an Armstrong number.
Math.Pow(3,3)=9 sum of this 1+125+9=153 is equals to be input 153 so it is Armstrong number.
Input: 1212                                                                                                                                                                
1212 is not an Armstrong number because the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits does not equal the original number.

For 1212:

The number has 4 digits (1, 2, 1, 2).
To check, we calculate the sum of each digit raised to the power of 4 (since there are 4 digits):

res=1^4+2^4+1^4+2^4=1+16+1+16=34
Since the sum (34) is not equal to the original number (1212), it is not an Armstrong number.
